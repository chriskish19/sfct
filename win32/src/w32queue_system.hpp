     * @brief A thread-safe queue system for managing and processing tasks in a multi-threaded environment.
     *
     * This class encapsulates a system for queuing and processing tasks of a generic type data_t in a multi-threaded context.
     * It provides mechanisms for adding tasks to a queue, processing these tasks in a dedicated thread, and safely managing
     * the lifecycle of task processing including synchronization and controlled shutdown. The class explicitly deletes copy
     * and move constructors and assignment operators to ensure each instance uniquely manages its resources and thread safety
     * considerations. It's designed to be flexible for various types of task processing by specializing the process_entry
     * function for the specific needs of the task type data_t.
